# zBlxsh

This is a little (but working) shell I did for a project in an compilation/langague course.
You have to unlock every functionnality by telling me what languages you like, but be carefull if I don't like them.
When you have every "good point", you make a request on a webhook, but unfortunately, it is a dead link now.
